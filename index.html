      <h2 class="text-paragraph montserrat-normal">
        Any mods that don't affect the gameplay too much are
        allowed, mods like Sodium and any other performance boosting mods are
        allowed, along with other mods that change how the game looks. Any mods that give you cheats or unfair advantages are not allowed. This does not include fullbright or low on fire. If you
